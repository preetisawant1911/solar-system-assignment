# ðŸŒŒ Solar System Assignment

This project is a JavaScript-based assignment that explores the solar system using arrays and objects. It is divided into two parts:


 Part 1: Array-Based Planet Data

- Uses an array of planet objects (`solarSystem`)
- Tasks include:
  - Printing specific moon data
  - Adding new moons and planets
  - Updating properties like `ringSystem` and `diameter`
  - Modifying moon names
  - Filtering planets with ring systems



Part 2: Object-Based Planet Data

- Uses a nested object structure (`system`)
- Tasks include:
  - Accessing properties like `mass`, `eccentricity`
  - Summing satellite counts
  - Validating and updating `radiusp` values
  - Calculating momentum differences between planets
